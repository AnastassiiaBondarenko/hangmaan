    - Ensured that input prompts and feedback messages were clear and user-friendly.

3. **Input Testing**:
    - Tested different user inputs, including letter guesses and responses to prompts.
    - Checked for any input validation and handling issues.

### Test Results

I'm happy to report that the manual testing process yielded successful results. The Hangman application performed as expected, and all tested scenarios were successful.

## Conclusion

The Hangman application has successfully passed both PEP 8 compliance testing and manual testing. It adheres to coding standards and delivers a user-friendly gaming experience.
